Slides: Blazor.pptx (in the slides folder)

Source Code: in the src folder

Overview: Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries. Developers with experience in Web Forms or MVC will find Blazer to provide an integrated full-stack solution to mobile development. Blazer is the next generation moving away from frameworks such as JavaScript, Angular, or React.
